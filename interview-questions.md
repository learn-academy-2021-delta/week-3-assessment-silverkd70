# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I think 'this' in JavaScript is to call on an object and it's specific function based on where the object is located.  

  Researched answer: It is a JavaScript keyword that refers to the object it belongs to. i.e. owner object in a method; global object in a function; undefined in a function in strict mode.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: It is a JavaScript library interface.  Developed by Facebook and it an open source platform.  It is used to build component functions to be stored as files which allows for import and export from the componenent file location to the Apps.js which helps with better function order, reliability, and can be reused istead of only be called upon for one specific funtion purpose.

  Researched answer: everything in React is a component which are independent and reusable pieces of code. It is used to build webpages and in additional application or mobile web pages because it can be used to build many small parts, and then joined together. It is very scalable.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: I believe that render is the lifecycle methong that is required in a React class component.

  Researched answer: after researching and seeing additional lifecycle methods, such as constructor and commit, is seems that render is the only required method in a class component



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: It is a hybrid version of JavaScript and Markup language that can utilize coding language as an extenstion that can perform both JavaScript and HTML commands, but within the JSX methods.  It helps to provide a more cohesive program style within React programming, component, and file creation and functionality.  I believe that HTML uses its own compiler which allows it to remain idependent on it's own .html document to have more functionality in web development, where JSX uses single HTML markup that has to be ran within JavaScript.  

  Researched answer: a few notable differences that I could find are the multiple elements can be returned in HTML and JSX must return one, which is the parent element.  JSX uses camelCase and HTML does not. And, in HTML almost all tags have an opening and closing tab, but in JSX any element can be written as a self-closing tag.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer:  I know it is a package management module that shows up as a yarn.lock file when added to the terminal by using the yarn command.  Yarn Add basically uncompressed the package manager which, I believe stores all the usable nodes/commands in order to assist in programming language (JSX/JavaScript/HTML) properly and solving issues with use of other developer programs, such as Just or React.  That's what I'm thinking since we run the yarn command before the Jest program testing or yarn start when running React.

  Researched answer: it is a package manager used in JavaScript that shares thousands of pieces of code to avoid rewriting basic components, libraries, or frameworks.  It doubles down as a project manager.  



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Maybe, based on the word anonymouse this is a function that is created at the time it is needed and does not need to be named at the time or can be given an uknown name that does not have to correlate with any specific naming required within that function? Glad I get to research this one.

  Researched answer: it is a function without a name and is often not accessible after its initial creation. Functions stored in variables do not need function names.  They are called by using the variable name.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: it is the ability to render different UI markup if a condition is true of false. It allows the user to render different elements or components based on a condition.

2. Props: are a kind of global variable or object that give the ability to communicate by passing data and methods between components.

3. JavaScript Events: the actions or occurrences that happen in the system and when JavaScript is used in HTML pages, it can react to these events.  These events provide a dynamic interfact to the webpage and are connected to elements in the DOM. i.e. Onclick and Onmoseoever events.

4. Object oriented programming: it is a programming paradigm that was created to deal with the complexity of large software systems.  It allows programmers to create containers for data that could be changed and manipulated without affecting the entire program.

5. Ruby: is a backend object-oriented language. It is a general-purpse, interpreted, dynamically-typed, server-side scripting language with many helpful built in methods and has a reputation for simplicity and a stlye that is easy to read and write.
